# ACRGS
This software repository contains the implementation of A novel adaptive cuboid regional growth algorithm for trunk-branch segmentation of fruit trees point cloud. The whole process includes point cloud preprocessing, adaptive rectangular region growth segmentation, and trunk and branch evaluation index methods.


# Statement
This study directly contributes to the Digital Earth concept by transforming geo-referenced 3D point cloud data into actionable information that enhances precision agriculture and smart orchard management. The proposed adaptive cuboid regional growth algorithm not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of trunk-branch segmentation in diverse fruit tree species but also supports the development of geo-data-intensive science and discovery. By providing a comprehensive evaluation framework and openly sharing datasets and code repositories, this study not only promotes the open dissemination and interoperability of digital resources, but also advances the vision of a collaborative and transparent Digital Earth ecosystem. Furthermore, by addressing challenges related to sustainable agriculture, climate resilience, and food security, the study advances the Digital Earth initiative's goals of improving societal conditions and supporting sustainable development.
