This software repository contains the implementation of A novel adaptive cuboid regional growth algorithm for trunk-branch segmentation of fruit trees point cloud. The whole process includes point cloud preprocessing, adaptive rectangular region growth segmentation, and trunk and branch evaluation index methods.

Part of the core code and preprocessing code has been uploaded, and all code will be uploaded publicly when the paper has been accepted.
